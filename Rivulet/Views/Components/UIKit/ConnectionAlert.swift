//
//  This replaces `ConnectionErrorBannerView`, which reserved 120pt of
//  `contentInset.top` on the home. The connection check resolves a second or
//  two after content renders, so every row jumped down 120pt mid-session, and
//  its Retry button was a focusable island floating outside the collection
//  view. A modal costs the layout nothing.
//
//  Two entry points:
//  - `presentOnceIfOffline` — unprompted, once per outage.
//  - `allowPlayback` — gates the one thing that genuinely cannot work from
//    cache. Browsing cached metadata is fine and is deliberately not gated.

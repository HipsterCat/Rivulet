//
//  ONE track list, not two.
//
//  The player straddles two descriptions of the same streams:
//
//  - AETHERENGINE knows WHICH stream. It demuxes the container, so its stream
//    index is the only value `selectAudioTrack` / `selectSubtitleTrack` accept.
//  - PLEX knows WHAT the stream is: the human display title, the long-form
//    `extendedDisplayTitle` ("English (AC3 5.1) - Director's Commentary"), and
//    its own scanner's flags. But its stream ids mean nothing to the engine.
//
//  Keeping these as two parallel arrays and re-deriving the correspondence at
//  each call site is what produced issue #201: a language+codec `first(where:)`
//  match collapsed three same-language subtitles onto one engine index, so only
//  the first was ever selectable.
//
//  So merge once, here, at load. Each merged track carries the ENGINE's id —
//  making it directly selectable — plus Plex's labels. Downstream there is a
//  single id space and no translation step, so the bug class is unrepresentable
//  rather than merely fixed.
//
//  THE JOIN KEY IS THE CONTAINER STREAM INDEX, NOT ORDINAL POSITION.
//
//  Both sides already carry it: AetherEngine's `TrackInfo.id` IS the container
//  stream index (its Demuxer walks every stream in `nb_streams` and passes the
//  loop counter straight through as the id), and Plex reports the same value as
//  `PlexStream.index`. Joining on it is container truth.
//
//  Position would NOT be safe, and the difference is not theoretical: Plex emits
//  EIA-608/708 closed captions that are baked into the video stream as their own
//  entries in `Part.Stream` (flagged `embeddedInVideo`, and the reason
//  `PlexStream._id` is optional). FFmpeg surfaces no separate AVStream for those,
//  so the engine never reports them. Counting ordinals would shift every real
//  subtitle by one and silently mislabel the whole list — reintroducing #201's
//  exact symptom by a different mechanism. Joining on stream index simply never
//  matches the phantom, and everything else lines up.
//
//  External sidecar subtitles are the one exception: they are not in the
//  container, so they have no stream index. They are registered with the engine
//  in metadata order (`aetherExternalSubtitles()`), so they pair by that order
//  among themselves.

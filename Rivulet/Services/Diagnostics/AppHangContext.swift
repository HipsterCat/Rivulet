//  Rivulet
//
//  Continuously-updated Sentry context for diagnosing main-thread App Hangs
//  (Sentry mechanism "AppHang" — see issue RIVULET-41).
//
//  Why this exists
//  ---------------
//  RIVULET-41 is a recurring "Fatal App Hang Fully Blocked": the main thread
//  blocked for >= 2s and the OS watchdog killed the app. The captured stack is
//  a Swift-concurrency executor job ending in `pthread_cond_wait`, but the
//  in-app frames don't symbolicate in the release build, so the event tells us
//  nothing about WHAT the user was doing.
//
//  App-hang events arrive with whatever breadcrumbs and scope tags were set at
//  the moment the watchdog fired. This type keeps a small, always-current
//  picture of app state on the Sentry scope so the NEXT hang event is
//  self-describing (which screen, which playback route, which playback state,
//  and the most recent main-thread checkpoint it passed through) even when the
//  frames themselves are unsymbolicated.
//
//  Note: the Sentry SDK is only started in release builds (see RivuletApp).
//  Every call here is a cheap no-op when the SDK isn't running, so callers
//  never need to guard on build configuration.
//
